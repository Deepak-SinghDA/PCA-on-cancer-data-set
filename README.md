## PCA-on-cancer-data-set
+ Here i an doing PCA on SKlearn load breast cancer data also did EDA and feature engineering
+ Hello Friends! Today, we discuss one of the most popular machine learning algorithms used by every data scientist 
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
  - Principal Components Analysis Using Skit-learn
  - Statistical & Mathematical concept behind PCA
+ In this article, more emphasis will be given to the two programming languages (R and Python) which we use to perform PCA. 
+ At the end of the article, you will see the difference between R and Python in terms of performing PCA.
###  **About Data Set**
   -  The dataset that we use for PCA is directly available in Scikit-learn.  This dataset contains breast cancer data of 569 females (observations). 
   -  The dimensionality of the dataset is 30. 
   - It means that there are 30 attributes (characteristics) for each female (observation) in the dataset.
